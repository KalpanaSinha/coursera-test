                    The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated fowl, 
                    a subspecies of the Red Junglefowl. As one of the most common
                     and widespread domestic animals with a population of more than
                      24 billion in 2003, there are more chickens in the world than 
                      any other species of bird. Humans keep chickens primarily as a 
                      source of food, consuming both their meat and their eggs.
